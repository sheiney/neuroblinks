# To do for stimulation version of Neuroblinks

## GUI

* ~~Add table entries for stimulation parameters to trial sequencing table or parameter window~~
    * ~~delay (window)~~
    * ~~train duration (table)~~
    * ~~pulse width (window)~~
    * ~~pulse frequency/period (table)~~
    * ~~pulse amplitude (table)~~
    * ~~stimulation device (laser/current) (window)~~

## Matlab code

* ~~Add PulsePal connection function to session start code~~
* ~~Add saving of stim parameters to metadata~~
* ~~Add sending of stim parameters to Teensy~~
* ~~Add sending of stim parameters to PulsePal~~

## Teensy firmware

* ~~Add stim trigger channel for triggering PulsePal during trial~~
* Make sure trials will be sequenced properly if no CS or US are presented
